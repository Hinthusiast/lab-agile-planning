Story Points: Practicing estimation techniques to size the effort required for tasks.

Sprint Planning: Learning how to collaboratively plan a sprint and create a realistic sprint backlog.

Team Roles: Understanding the responsibilities of the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team in the planning process.
